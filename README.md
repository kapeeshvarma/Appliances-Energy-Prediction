# Appliances-Energy-Prediction
## A Regression Analysis and Prediction project on the Energy consumption of Home Appliances.

In this project, we analyse the data from different sensors along with other weather features in order to predict the power consumption of Home Appliances. The dataset used consists of sensor data taken at 10 minute intervals for 4.5 months. Weather data was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non-predictive attributes (parameters). Regression has been performed on this data using different models such as Linear Regressor, Random Forests etc., and the performance and accuracy of these models have been calculated to find the best fit.
